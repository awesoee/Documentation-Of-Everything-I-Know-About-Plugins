# Fundamental Knowledge

**Plugins are typically written in TypeScript and utilize the React and React-DOM libraries.** You really don't need to be an expert in any of these in order to make plugins (typescript has a *very* similar syntax to hscript, the language used to make fraytools characters) but the more knowledge the better.

Here are a couple resources to learn more:
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)
- [React References](https://react.dev/reference/react#)



There are four plugin types natively supported by Fraytools:

**Metadata Plugins** - Add custom buttons and fields to the Properties panel <br/>
**Publish Plugins** - Create your own UI for exporting/publishing Fraytools projects <br/>
**Types Plugins** - Create custom type definitions <br/>
**Script Asset Plugins** - Add additional pages to the script editor <br/>

# Setting Up

- You will need an IDE (Integrated Development Environment, basically code editor) to create plugins. I reccommend [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
- Install the latest LTS version of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/).
- Install one of my [upgraded example plugins](https://github.com/awesoee/ts-types-plugin-example/tree/main)
