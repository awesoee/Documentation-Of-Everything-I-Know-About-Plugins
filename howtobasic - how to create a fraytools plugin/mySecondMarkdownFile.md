# Fundamental Knowledge

Plugins are typically written in TypeScript and utilize the React and React-DOM libraries. You really don't need to be an expert in any of these in order to make plugins (typescript has a *very* similar syntax to hscript, the language used to make fraytools characters) but the more knowledge the better.

Here are a couple resources to learn more:
- [TypeScript Documentation](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/)
- [React Tutorial](https://react.dev/learn)
- [React References](https://react.dev/reference/react#)
